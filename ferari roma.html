                   <P>Despite Ferrari’s design being heavily criticized in recent years, most people agree that the new Ferrari Roma is one of the best looking Ferraris in a long time. Maranello’s latest twin-turbo V8 GT appears sleek and reserved, and it is being compared to other low-key supercars such as Aston Martins and Porsches. Yes, these days you can be classy and minimal while also having 612 horsepower, launching from 0-62 mph in 3.4 seconds, and sounding like an Italian monster. This is all thanks to the sweeping, elegant design of the Roma</P>
