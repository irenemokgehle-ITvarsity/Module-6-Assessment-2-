                   <h1>BMW X2</h1>
                  
                   
                   <P>This is a new name, and an additional model in the BMW range, without a direct predecessor. Even so, it’s hard to imagine a new arrival that needs less explaining than the X2.

It’s a lower, sleeker, sportier and slightly less roomy counterpart to the X1. You know, like the X4 is to the X3, or the X6 to the X5.

                       So it’s a crossover for people who are willing to compromise on back-seat and boot space (though not that much). In return they get sleeker looks and a slightly sportier drive.</P>
