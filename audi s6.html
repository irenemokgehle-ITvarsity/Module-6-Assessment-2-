                   <P>With its understated exterior, the 2021 Audi S6 maintains its role as the under-the-radar performance sedan of the luxury segment.Sportiness meets efficiency – the new Audi S6 models make their entrance with torquey V6 TDI engines, offering customers in Europe the ideal performance models for the long haul. For the first time, Audi has combined an electric powered compressor with a 48-volt primary electrical system. The S sport suspension with damping control, dynamic all-wheel steering and the ceramic brake system tick all the boxes for dynamic cornering and deceleration. The striking design with the sophisticated looks of an S model lends these sporty full-size models particular presence.
