                   <p> The Toyota Hilux pickup truck has become one of the most iconic vehicles to ever emerge from Japanese vehicle maker Toyota.

The Hilux, known as the Pickup or Pickup Truck in the US market, has the distinction of having been to both North and South Poles and while on a North Pole journey for Top Gear went to the top of Eyjafjallajökull, the “unpronounceable mountain” in Iceland.</p>
