                   <h1>FERRARI 812 GTS</h1>
                  
                   
                   <P>Half a century - that's how long there hasn't been a series production front-engined V12 Ferrari Spider; sure there have been others such as the F12 TRS and F60 America, but you're more likely to solve the Middle Eastern conflict than find one of those for sale - they were limited-run models that owners selected before the world even saw the show cars. But in the modern world, the high-end performance car market demands every possible configuration and power level under the sun!

Enter the 812 GTS, the convertible version of the insane 812 Superfast, which bowled us over when it was first launched. What makes the 812 GTS so unique is the fact that it's powered by a 6.5-liter V12 that produces nearly 800 horsepower, and will do over 200 mph with the top down.â€ƒ</P>
