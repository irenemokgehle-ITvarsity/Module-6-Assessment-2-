                   <P>Rumors of a possible BMW two-seat roadster, dubbed the Z2, have been swirling for some time now. But with BMW launching one new model after another, talks about the Z2 have been relegated to low whispers. But donâ€™t misinterpret inaction for dead action because BMW still has plans for the Z2, as it has released new details that ought to give us a fresh idea on what to expect from the entry-level roadster.</P>
