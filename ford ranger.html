                   <P>If there's one thing that Aussie tradies are spoiled for, it's choice.

                       With the number of big, ladder-framed light commercial utes on offer, it's difficult for any single truck to rise to the top. One truck has done it, however; bigger and bolder than ever before, the Ford Ranger's popularity has escalated to the point that it's stealing the thunder of the previously unassailable Toyota HiLux. The Ranger name has only been used in Australia since 2006, but that doesn't mean that Ford is new to the party. Ford Ranger is really just a new name for the Ford Courier, a nameplate that was used in Australia since 1979.</P>
